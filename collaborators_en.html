					Since my Master’s degree in Commercial Vehicle Technology at the University of Kaiserslautern-Landau (RPTU), I have been working in the Safety Engineering domain. I work in the area of dependable machine learning, for which I have worked in several national and international projects. Projects including SECREDAS, BIECO, SESAME, and SPELL, to name but a few. I have worked in a variety of safety-critical and finance-critical applications, ranging from pedestrian/person detection (SESAME) to investment portfolio prediction (BIECO).
